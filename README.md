# phpbitdb

This is an example of how to use BitDB and Bitsocket with PHP. It assumes PHP has cURL and provides two simple methods for interfacing with BitDB.

`bitdb.php` -- this is the "library", you can drop this file into your project and use the two utility methods if you wish. `example.php` shows you how to do so.
